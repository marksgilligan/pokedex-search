What to track(useState)
-what is typed into the search field (searchTerm)
-what is in the AutoComplete list options (listOptions)
-what is selected from the autoCompleted(Result)

How do these interact with our components

-searchTerm 
    needs to be seen by searchbar/SearchField
    needs to be seen by AutoComplete/OptionsList
    needs to be edited by the AutoComplete/Option
        needs to be able to set searchTerm when selecting an option
    needs to be edited by the SearchBar/SearchField
        needs to be able to set the searchTerm when typing into the input
searchTerm state needs to live in PokeSuggest

-listOptions 
    is dependant on searchTerm
    needs to be edited by SearchField/SearchBar
listOptions state needs to live in AutoComplete

-result 
    needs to be seen by PokemonDisplay()
    needs to be edited by SearchBar/SearchButton
    - when you click the button we need to be able to set result to be searchTerm
result needs to live in PokeSuggest

Pokemon API

searchTerm dictates

fetch - when searchTerm changes - options(state)
        - AutoComplete prop includes searchTerm, react to that prop changes and create a new fetch request. 
        useEffect with a fetch request dependant on searchterm
      - when we click button to grab result -result(state))
